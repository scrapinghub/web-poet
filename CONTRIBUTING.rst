Contributing
============

``web-poet`` is an open-source project and we'd love to accept your
contributions. There are just a few small guidelines that you need to follow.

How to report issues
--------------------

Please, create a new issue on this repository if you have:

* a bug
* a new feature
* a change proposal

Make sure to include all necessary details that could help other contributors
to understand or to reproduce your use case.

How to submit a patch
---------------------

* Fork the project
* Create a new branch with your patch
* Open a pull request to master
* Ask for code reviews from other contributors

Ideally, tests should keep passing and coverage should not decrease after a
commit.
