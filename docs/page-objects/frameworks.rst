:ref:`Page objects <page-objects>` are not meant to be used in isolation with
web-poet. They are meant to be usable with any Python web scraping framework or
library that implements the :ref:`web-poet specification <spec>`, either
directly or through a third-party plugin.

At the moment, the only production-ready web-poet framework that exists is
scrapy-poet_, which brings web-poet support to Scrapy_.

As web-poet matures and sees wider adoption, we hope to see more frameworks add
support for it.
