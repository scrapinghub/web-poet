Installation
============

To be able to write :ref:`page objects <page-objects>` and :ref:`test them
<web-poet-testing>`, install web-poet `from PyPI`_:

.. _from PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/web-poet/

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install web-poet

To use page objects in production, however, you will need a :ref:`web-poet
framework <frameworks>`.
