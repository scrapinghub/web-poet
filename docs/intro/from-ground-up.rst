From the ground up
==================

Learn why and how web-poet came to be as you transform a simple, rigid starting
web scraping code snippet into maintainable, reusable web-poet code.

Writing reusable parsing code
=============================

Imagine you are writing code to scrape a book web page from
`books.toscrape.com <http://books.toscrape.com/>`_, and you implement a
``scrape`` function like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from parsel import Selector


    def scrape(url: str) -> dict:
        response = requests.get(url)
        selector = Selector(response.text)
        return {
            "url": response.url,
            "title": selector.css("h1").get(),
        }

    item = scrape("http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html")

This ``scrape`` function is simple, but it has a big issue: it only supports
downloading the specified URL using the requests_ library. What if you want to
use aiohttp_, for concurrency support? What if you want to run ``scrape`` with
a local snapshot of a URL response, to write an automated test for ``scrape``
that does not rely on a network connection?

.. _aiohttp: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp
.. _requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The first step towards addressing this issue is to split your ``scrape``
function into 2 separate functions, ``download`` and ``parse``:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from parsel import Selector


    def parse(response: requests.Response) -> dict:
        selector = Selector(response.text)
        return {
            "url": response.url,
            "title": selector.css("h1").get(),
        }

    def download(url: str) -> requests.Response:
        return requests.get(url)

    url = "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html"
    response = download(url)
    item = parse(response)

Now that ``download`` and ``parse`` are separate functions, you can replace
``download`` with an alternative implementation that uses aiohttp_, or that
reads from local files.

There is still an issue, though: ``parse`` expects an instance of
`requests.Response`_. Any alternative implementation of ``download`` would need
to create a response object of the same type, forcing a dependency on
requests_ even if downloads are handled with a different library.

.. _requests.Response: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Response

So you need to change the input of the ``parse`` function into something that
will not tie you to a specific download library. One option is to create your
own, download-independent ``Response`` class, to store the response data that
any download function should be able to provide:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from parsel import Selector


    @dataclass
    class Response:
        url: str
        text: str


    def parse(response: Response) -> dict:
        selector = Selector(response.text)
        return {
            "url": response.url,
            "title": selector.css("h1").get(),
        }


    def download(url: str) -> Response:
        response = requests.get(url)
        return Response(url=response.url, text=response.text)


    url = "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html"
    response = download(url)
    item = parse(response)


The ``parse`` function is no longer tied to any specific download library, and
alternative versions of the ``download`` function can be implemented with other
libraries.


Switching to web-poet
=====================

web-poet asks you to organize your code in a very similar way. Letâ€™s
iteratively switch to the web-poet approach now.

First, convert the ``parse`` function into a :ref:`page object class
<page-object-classes>`:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from web_poet import ItemPage, HttpResponse


    class BookPage(ItemPage):
        def __init__(self, response: HttpResponse):
            self.response = response

        def to_item(self) -> dict:
            return {
                "url": self.response.url,
                "title": self.response.css("h1").get(),
            }


    def download(url: str) -> Response:
        response = requests.get(url)
        return HttpResponse(
            url=response.url,
            body=response.content,
            headers=response.headers,
        )


    url = "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html"
    response = download(url)
    book_page = BookPage(response=response)
    item = book_page.to_item()


Differences from a previous example:

-   web-poet provides a standard :class:`~.HttpResponse` class, with helper
    methods like :meth:`~.HttpResponse.css`.

    Note how headers are passed when creating :class:`~.HttpResponse` instance.
    This is needed to decode body (which is ``bytes``) to text properly, using
    the web browser rules. It involves checking ``Content-Encoding`` header,
    meta tags in HTML, BOM markers in the body, etc.

-   Instead of the ``parse`` function we've got a ``BookPage`` class, which
    inherits from the :class:`~.ItemPage` base class, receives response data in
    its ``__init__`` method, and returns the extracted item in the
    ``to_item()`` method. ``to_item`` is a standard method name used by
    ``web-poet``.

Receiving a ``response`` argument in ``__init__`` is very common for page
objects, so ``web-poet`` provides a shortcut for it: inherit from
:class:`~.WebPage`, which provides this ``__init__`` method implementation. You
can then refactor your ``BookPage`` class as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import WebPage

    class BookPage(WebPage):
        def to_item(self) -> dict:
            return {
                "url": self.response.url,
                "title": self.response.css("h1").get(),
            }

At this point you may be wondering why web-poet requires you to write a class
with a ``to_item`` method rather than a function. The answer is flexibility.

It is common to have Page Objects for a web page where a single main
data record needs to be extracted (e.g. book information in our example).
``web-poet`` standardizes this, by asking to name a method implementing the
extraction ``to_item``.

As the method name is now standardized, the code which creates a Page Object
instance can now work for other Page Objects like that. For example, you can
have ``ToscrapeBookPage`` and ``BamazonBookPage`` classes, and

.. code-block:: python

    def get_item(page_cls: WebPage, response: HttpResponse) -> dict:
        page = page_cls(response=response)
        return page.to_item()

would work for both.

But wait. Before the example was converted to ``web-poet``, we were getting
it for free:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_item(extract_func, response: HttpResponse) -> dict:
        return extract_func(url=response.url, text=response.text)

No need to agree on ``to_item`` name or have a base class.
Why bother with classes then?

Classes for web scraping code
=============================

A matter of preference. Functions are great, too.
Classes sometimes can make it a easier to organize web scraping code.
For example, we can extract logic for different attributes into properties:

.. code-block:: python

    class BookPage(WebPage):
        """
        A book page on http://books.toscrape.com website, e.g.
        http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html
        """

        @property
        def title(self):
            return self.response.css("h1").get()

        @property
        def description(self):
            return self.response.css("#product_description+ p").get().strip()

        def to_item(self):
            return {
                "url": self.response.url,
                "title": self.title,
                "description": self.description,
                # ...
            }

It might be easier to read the code written this way. Also, this style
allows to extract only some of the attributes - if you don't need
the complete to_item() output, you still can access individual properties.

web-poet provides a small framework to simplify writing Page Objects
in this style; see :ref:`fields`. The example above can be simplified
using web-poet fields - there is no need to write ``to_item`` boilerplate:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import WebPage, field

    class BookPage(WebPage):
        """
        A book page on http://books.toscrape.com website, e.g.
        http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html
        """

        @field
        def title(self):
            return self.response.css("h1").get()

        @field
        def description(self):
            return self.response.css("#product_description+ p").get().strip()

        @field
        def url(self):
            return self.response.url

.. note::
    The ``BookPage.to_item()`` method is ``async`` in the example above.
    Make sure to check :ref:`fields` if you want to use web-poet fields.

Another reason to consider classes for the extraction code is that sometimes
there is no a single "main" method, but you still want to group the related code.
For example, you may define a "Pagination" page object:

.. code-block:: python

    class Pagination(WebPage):

        def page_urls(self):
            # ...

        def prev_url(self):
            # ...

        def next_url(self):
            # ...

or a Listing page on a web site, where you need to get URLs to individual
pages and pagination URLs:

.. code-block:: python

    class BookListPage(ProductListingPage):
        def item_urls(self):
            return self.response.css(".product a::attr(href)").getall()

        def page_urls(self):
            return self.response.css(".paginator a::attr(href)").getall()


Web Scraping Frameworks
=======================

Let's recall the example we started with:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import parsel


    def extract_book(url):
        """ Extract book information from a book page on
        http://books.toscrape.com website, e.g. from
        http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html
        """
        resp = requests.get(url)
        sel = parsel.Selector(resp)
        return {
            "url": resp.url,
            "title": sel.response.css("h1").get(),
            "description": sel.response.css("#product_description+ p").get().strip(),
            # ...
        }

    item = extract_book("http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html")

And this is what we ended up with:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from web_poet import WebPage, HttpResponse


    # === Extraction code
    class BookPage(WebPage):
        """ A book page on http://books.toscrape.com website, e.g.
        http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html
        """
        def to_item(self):
            return {
                "url": self.response.url,
                "title": self.response.css("h1").get(),
                "description": self.response.css("#product_description+ p").get().strip(),
                # ...
            }

    # === Framework-specific I/O code
    def download_sync(url):
        resp = requests.get(url)
        return HttpResponse(url=resp.url, body=resp.content, headers=resp.headers)

    async def download_async(url):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                body = await response.content.read()
                headers = response.headers

        return HttpResponse(url=resp.url, body=body, headers=headers)

    # === Usage example
    def get_item(page_cls: WebPage, resp_data: HttpResponse) -> dict:
        page = page_cls(response=resp_data)
        return page.to_item()

    # the way to get resp_data depends on an HTTP client
    response = download_sync("http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html")
    item = get_item(BookPage, resp_data=response)

We created a monster!!! The examples in this tutorial are becoming
longer and longer, harder and harder to understand. What's going on?

To understand better why this is happening, let's check the ``web-poet``
example in more detail. There are 3 main sections:

1. Extraction code
2. Lower-level I/O code
3. "Usage example" - it connects (1) and (2) to get the extracted data.

Extraction code needs to be written for every new web site.
But the I/O code and the "Usage example" can, and should be written only once!

In other words, we've been creating a web scraping framework here, and that's
where most of the complexity is coming from.

In a real world, a developer who needs to extract data from a web page
would only need to write the "extraction" part:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import WebPage

    class BookPage(WebPage):
        """ A book page on http://books.toscrape.com website, e.g.
        http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html
        """
        def to_item(self):
            return {
                "url": self.response.url,
                "title": self.response.css("h1").get(),
                "description": self.response.css("#product_description+ p").get().strip(),
                # ...
            }

Then point the framework to the ``BookPage`` class, tell which web page
to process, and that's it:

.. code-block:: python

    item = some_framework.extract(url, BookPage)

``web-poet`` **does not** provide such a framework.
The role of ``web-poet`` is to define a standard on how to write the
extraction logic, and allow it to be reused in different frameworks.
``web-poet`` Page Objects should be flexible enough to be used with:

* synchronous or async frameworks, callback-based and
  ``async def / await`` based,
* single node and distributed systems,
* different underlying HTTP implementations - or without HTTP support
  at all, etc.

Page Objects
============

In this document "Page Objects" were casually mentioned a few times, but
what are they?

.. note::
    This term comes from a Page Object design pattern; see a description
    on Martin Fowler's website: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html.
    web-poet page objects are inspired by Martin Fowler's page object,
    but they are not the same.

Essentially, the idea is to create an object which represents a web page
(or a part of web page - recall the ``Pagination`` example), and allows
to extract data from there. Page Object must:

1. Define all the inputs needed in its ``__init__`` method.
   Usually these inputs are then stored as attributes.

2. Provide methods or properties to extract structured information,
   using the data saved in ``__init__``.

3. Inherit from :class:`~.Injectable`; this inheritance is used as a marker.

For example, a very basic Page Object could look like this:

   .. code-block:: python

        from parsel import Selector
        from web_poet.pages import Injectable
        from web_poet.page_inputs import HttpResponse


        class BookPage(Injectable):
            def __init__(self, response: HttpResponse):
                self.response = response

            def to_item(self) -> dict:
                return {
                    "url": str(self.response.url),
                    "title": self.response.css("h1::text").get()
                }

There is no *need* to use other base classes and mixins
defined by ``web-poet`` (:class:`~.WebPage`, :class:`~.ItemPage`, etc.),
but it can be a good idea to familiarize yourself with them, as they are
taking some of the boilerplate out.

Page Object Inputs
==================

Here we got to the last, and probably the most complicated and important part
of ``web-poet``. So far we've been passing :class:`~.HttpResponse` to
the page objects. But is it enough?

If that'd be enough, there wouldn't be ``web-poet``. We would say "please
write ``def extract(url, html): ...`` functions", and call it a day.

In practice you may need to use other information to extract data from
a web page, not only :class:`~.HttpResponse`. For example, you may want
to

* render a web page in a headless browser like Splash_,
  and use HTML after the rendering (snapshot of a DOM tree);
* query third-party API like AutoExtract_, to extract most of the data
  automatically - a Page Object may just return the result as-is,
  or enrich / post-process it;
* take some state in account, passed e.g. from the crawling code.
* use a combination of inputs: e.g. you may need HTML after
  Headless Chrome rendering + crawling state.

.. _Splash: https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash
.. _AutoExtract: https://www.zyte.com/automatic-extraction/

The information you need can depend on a web site.
For example, Splash can be required for extracting book information from
Bamazon, while for http://books.toscrape.com you may need HTTP response body
and some crawl state (not really, but let's imagine it is needed).
You may define page objects for this task:

.. code-block:: python

    class BamazonBookPage(Injectable):
        def __init__(self, response: SplashResponse):
            self.response = response

        def to_item(self):
            # ...

    class ToScrapeBookPage(Injectable):
        def __init__(self, response: HttpResponse, crawl_state: dict):
            self.response = response
            self.crawl_state = crawl_state

        def to_item(self):
            # ...

Then, we would like to use these page objects in some web scraping
framework, like we did before:

.. code-block:: python

    item1 = some_framework.extract(bamazon_url, BamazonBookPage)
    item2 = some_framework.extract(toscrape_url, ToScrapeBookPage)

To be able to implement the imaginary ``some_framework.extract`` method,
some_framework must

1. Figure out somehow which inputs the Page Objects need.
2. Create these inputs. If needed, make a Splash request, make a direct HTTP
   request, get a dictionary with the crawl state from somewhere. These
   actions can be costly; framework should avoid doing unnecessary work here.
3. Pass the obtained data as keyword arguments to ``__init__`` method.

`(2)` and `(3)` are straightforward, once the framework knows that
"To create BamazonBookPage, I need to pass output of Splash as
a ``response`` keyword argument", i.e. once `(1)` is done.

``web-poet`` uses  **type annotations** of ``__init__`` arguments
to declare Page Object dependencies. So, type annotations in the
examples like the following were not just a nice-thing-to-have:

.. code-block:: python

    class BookPage(Injectable):
        def __init__(self, response: HttpResponse):
            self.response = response

By annotating ``__init__`` arguments we were actually
telling ``web-poet`` (or, more precisely, a framework
which uses ``web-poet``):

    To create a ``BookPage`` instance, please obtain :class:`~.HttpResponse`
    instance somehow, and pass it as a ``response`` keyword argument.
    That's all you need to create a ``BookPage`` instance.

.. note::

    If it sounds like Dependency Injection, you're right.

If something other than :class:`~.HttpResponse` needs to be passed,
a different type annotation should be used:

.. code-block:: python

    class BamazonBookPage(Injectable):
        def __init__(self, response: SplashResponse):
            self.response = response

    class ToScrapeBookPage(Injectable):
        def __init__(self, response: HttpResponse, crawl_state: CrawlState):
            self.response = response
            self.crawl_state = crawl_state

For each possible input a separate class needs to be defined, even if the
data has the same format. For example, both :class:`~.HttpResponse` and
``SplashResponse`` may have the same ``url`` and ``text`` properties,
but they can't be the same class, because they need to work as
"markers" - tell frameworks if the html should be taken from HTTP
response body or from Splash DOM snapshot.

``CrawlState`` in the example above can be defined as a class with
some specific properties, or maybe even
as a ``class CrawlState(dict): pass`` - an important thing is that it is
an unique type, and that we agree on what should be put into
arguments annotated as ``CrawlState``.

Pro tip: defining classes like

.. code-block:: python

    class ToScrapeBookPage(Injectable):
        def __init__(self, response: HttpResponse, crawl_state: CrawlState):
            self.response = response
            self.crawl_state = crawl_state

can get tedious; Python's :mod:`dataclasses`
(or `attrs`_, if that's your preference) make it nicer:

.. code-block:: python

    from dataclasses import dataclass

    @dataclass
    class ToScrapeBookPage(Injectable):
        response: HttpResponse
        crawl_state: CrawlState

.. _attrs: https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs

web-poet role
=============

How do you actually inspect the ``__init__`` method signature - e.g.
if you're working on supporting ``web-poet`` page objects in some
framework? ``web-poet`` itself doesn't provide any helpers for doing this.

Use andi_ library. For example, scrapy-poet_ uses andi_.
In addition to signature inspection, it also handles
:class:`typing.Optional` and :class:`typing.Union`, and allows to create a build
plan for dependency trees, indirect dependencies: that's allowed to annotate
an argument as another :class:`~.Injectable` subclass.

``web-poet`` is not using andi_ on its own; ``web-poet``'s role
is to standardize things + provide some helpers to write the
extraction code easier:

1. Standardize a list of possible inputs for the page objects. This helps with
   reusability of extraction code across different environments. For example,
   if you want to support extraction from raw HTTP response bodies, you
   need to figure out how to populate :class:`~.HttpResponse` in the
   given environment, and that's all.

   Users are free to define their own inputs (input types), but they
   may be less portable across environments - which can be fine.

2. Define an interface for the Page Object itself. This allows to
   have a code which can instantiate and use a Page Object without knowing
   about its implementation upfront. ``web-poet`` requires you to
   use a base class (:class:`~.Injectable`), and defines the
   semantics of ``to_item()`` method.


Then, framework's role is to:

1. Figure out which inputs a Page Object needs, likely using andi_ library.
2. Create all the necessary inputs. For example, creating
   :class:`~.HttpResponse` instance may involve making an HTTP request;
   creating ``CrawlState`` (from the previous examples) may involve getting
   some data from the shared storage, or from an in-memory data structure.
3. Create a Page Object instance, passing it the inputs it needs.
4. Depending on a task, either return a newly created Page Object
   instance to the user, or call some predefined method
   (a common case is ``to_item``).

For example, ``web-poet`` + Scrapy integration package (scrapy-poet_)
inspects a WebPage subclass you defined, figures out it needs
:class:`~.HttpResponse` and nothing else, fetches Scrapy's ``TextResponse``,
creates an :class:`~.HttpResponse` instance from it, creates your
Page Object instance, and passes it to a spider callback.

Finally, the Developer's role is to:

1. Write a Page Object class, likely website-specific, following ``web-poet``
   standards. The extraction code should define the inputs it needs
   (such as "body of HTTP response", "Chrome DOM tree snapshot",
   "crawl state"); it shouldn't fetch these inputs itself.
2. Pass the Page Object class to a framework, in a way defined by the
   framework.
3. Receive a Page Object *instance* from the framework; call its extraction methods
   (e.g. ``to_item``). Depending on the framework and on the task, the framework
   may be calling ``to_item`` (or other methods) automatically; in this case
   user code would be getting the extracted data, not a Page Object instance.

Summary
=======

First, congratulations for making it through this document!

A take-away from this tutorial:

1. ``web-poet`` does very little on its own. Almost nothing, really.
   An important thing about ``web-poet`` is that if defines a standard
   for writing web scraping code.

   All these Page Objects are just Python classes, which receive some
   static data in ``__init__`` methods, and maybe provide some methods to
   extract the data.

2. ``web-poet`` prescribes certain things and limits what you can do,
   but not too much, and as a return you're getting better testability
   and reusability of your code.

3. Hopefully, now you understand how to write a web scraping framework
   which uses ``web-poet``.

4. Basic ``web-poet`` usage looks similar to how one could have had
   refactored the extraction code anyways.
