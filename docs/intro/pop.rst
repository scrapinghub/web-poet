Page Object Projects (POP)
==========================

**POPs** are a way to standardize how a group of Page Objects are packaged
together so they can be uniformly used in other projects. More importantly,
**POPs** could be built using other **POPs**. This allows for continuous
improvements by building **POPs** on top of one another.

Organizing POP
--------------

Developers have complete freedom on how to organize their Page Objects
in their projects. Here are some of the options that developers could use.

Flat Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A good default option for organizing Page Objects would be to simply have
their respective modules in a flat hierarchy as seen in the example below.

.. code-block::

    ecommerce-page-objects
    ├── ecommerce_page_objects
    |   ├── __init__.py
    |   ├── cool_gadget_site_us_products.py
    |   ├── cool_gadget_site_us_product_listings.py
    |   ├── cool_gadget_site_fr_products.py
    |   ├── cool_gadget_site_fr_product_listings.py
    |   ├── furniture_shop_products.py
    |   └── furniture_shop_product_listings.py
    └── setup.py  

However, when your Page Object Project grows, it may be difficult to manage
a flat structure like this.

Hierarchical Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One key advantage for organizing the Page Objects into a hierarchy
of subpackages is that large websites could be broken further into
its more granular form.

A quick example would be websites having multiple country-specific
domains. This could easily be grouped as something like:

.. code-block::

    ecommerce-page-objects
    ├── ecommerce_page_objects
    |   ├── cool_gadget_site
    |   |   ├── us
    |   |   |   ├── __init__.py
    |   |   |   ├── products.py
    |   |   |   └── product_listings.py
    |   |   ├── fr
    |   |   |   ├── __init__.py
    |   |   |   ├── products.py
    |   |   |   └── product_listings.py
    |   |   └── __init__.py
    |   ├── furniture_shop
    |   |   ├── __init__.py
    |   |   ├── products.py
    |   |   └── product_listings.py
    |   └── __init__.py
    └── setup.py

Requirements for POP
--------------------

Minimum Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This covers the basic use case:

    - Installation of **POP** either from public or private repositories:
  
      - PyPI
      - Git

    - Version specifiers that can be used to accommodate the various parser patches
      that come along in any web data extraction project.
    - Importing the Page Objects directly from the installed package in a project.


This means that **POPs** need to have:

    - The ``setup.py`` script which is the standard way of distributing Python packages.

Thus, the most basic way of packaging **POPs** would be:

.. code-block:: python

    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    setup(
        name='ecommerce-page-objects',
        version='1.0.0',
        packages=find_packages(),
        install_requires=["web-poet"]
    )

This allows the **POP** to be installable via ``pip install ecommerce-page-objects==1.0.0``
`(assuming it's deployed in PyPI)` or via a Git repo like 
``pip install git+https://github.com/some-org/ecommerce-page-objects.git@1.0.0``
`(assuming the repo is public)`.

After installing the **POP**, anyone could access the Page Objects in it
by simply importing them:

.. code-block:: python

    from ecommerce_page_objects.furniture_shop.products import FurnitureProductPage

    response = download_response("https://www.furnitureshop.com/product/xyz")
    page = FurnitureProductPage(response)
    item = page.to_item()

.. _`pop-recommended-requirements`:

Recommended Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This covers these use cases:

    - The `minimum requirements` and its use cases 
    - The ability to retrieve the declared :class:`~.OverrideRule`
      available inside the **POP**

This means that a collection of :class:`~.OverrideRule` must be properly
discovered within the **POP**. This enables projects using the **POP** to know:

    - which URL Patterns a given Page Object is expected to work
    - what it's trying to override `(or replace)`

To give an example, suppose our **POP** is named **ecommerce_page_objects**
and is using any of the project structure options discussed in the
previous sections. We can then define the entry point of discovering
all :class:`~.OverrideRule` by writing the following code inside of
``ecommerce-page-objects/ecommerce_page_objects/__init__.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import default_registry

    REGISTRY = default_registry.export(__package__)

This does two things:

    1. The :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.export` method returns a new instance of
    :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` which contains only the :class:`~.OverrideRule`
    from the given package. This means that if there are other **POPs** using the
    recommended ``default_registry``, any :class:`~.OverrideRule` that are not part
    of the package are not included.

    2. Remember that code in Python like annotations are only read and executed
    when the module it belongs to is imported. Thus, in order for all the
    ``@handle_urls`` annotation to properly reflect its data, they need to
    be imported recursively via :func:`~.consume_modules`. Fortunately,
    :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.export` already consumes the ``__package__``
    for us.

This allows developers to properly access all of the :class:`~.OverrideRule`
declared using the ``@handle_urls`` annotation inside the **POP**:

.. code-block:: python

    import ecommerce_page_objects

    ecommerce_rules = ecommerce_page_objects.get_overrides()

At the same time, this also allows **POPs** which use ``web_poet.default_registry``
to have all their rules discovered if they are adhering to using Convention **#3**
(see :ref:`conventions-and-best-practices`). In other words, importing the
``ecommerce_page_objects`` **POP** to a project immediately loads all of the rules
in **web-poet's** ``default_registry``:

.. code-block:: python

    import ecommerce_page_objects

    ecommerce_rules = ecommerce_page_objects.get_overrides()

    from web_poet import default_registry

    # All the rules are also available once ecommerce_page_objects is imported.
    all_rules = default_registry.get_overrides()

If this recommended requirement is followed properly, there's no need to
call ``consume_modules("ecommerce_page_objects")`` before performing the
:meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.get_overrides`, since all the :class:`~.OverrideRule`
were already discovered upon **POP** importation. 

Lastly, when trying to repackage multiple **POPs** into a single unifying **POP**
which contains all of the :class:`~.OverrideRule`, it can easily be packaged
as:

.. code-block:: python

    from web_poet import PageObjectRegistry

    import base_A_package
    import base_B_package

    # If on Python 3.9+
    combined_reg = base_A_package.REGISTRY | base_B_package.REGISTRY

    # If on lower Python versions
    combined_reg = {**base_A_package.REGISTRY, **base_B_package.REGISTRY}

    REGISTRY = PageObjectRegistry(combined_reg)

Note that you can also opt to use only a subset of the :class:`~.OverrideRule`
by selecting the specific ones in ``combined_reg`` before creating a new
:class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` instance. An **inclusion** rule is preferred than
an **exclusion** rule (see **Tip #4** in the :ref:`conventions-and-best-practices`).
You can use :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.search_overrides` when selecting the
rules.

.. _`conventions-and-best-practices`:

Conventions and Best Practices
------------------------------

1. Page Objects should have its classname end with a **Page** suffix.
   This allows for easy identification when used by other developers.

2. The list of :class:`~.OverrideRule` must be declared as a top-level
   variable from the package named ``REGISTRY``. This enables other developers
   to easily retrieve the list of :class:`~.OverrideRule` to be used in
   their own projects.

3. It is recommended to use the ``web_poet.default_registry`` by default
   instead of creating your own custom registries by instantiating
   :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry`. This provides a default expectation
   for developers on which registry to use right from the start.

    * However, there will be some cases where creating a new instance of
      :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` is inevitably needed. Here's an
      :ref:`example <overrides-custom-registry>` in the tutorial section.

4. When building a new **POP** based of on existing **POPs**, it is
   recommended to use an **inclusion** strategy rather than **exclusion**
   when selecting the list of :class:`~.OverrideRule` to export.
   This is due to the latter having the risk of being brittle when the
   underlying source **POPs** change. This could lead to a few
   :class:`~.OverrideRule` that are unintentionally included.
