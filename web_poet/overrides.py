    for a given URL matching rule.

    Note that it's simply a ``dict`` subclass with added functionalities on
    storing, retrieving, and searching for the :class:`~.OverrideRule` instances.
    The **value** represents the :class:`~.OverrideRule` instance from which the
    Page Object in the **key** is allowed to be used. Since it's essentially a
    ``dict``, you can use any ``dict`` operations with it.

    ``web-poet`` already provides a default Registry named ``default_registry``
    for convenience. It can be directly accessed via:

    .. code-block:: python

        from web_poet import handle_urls, default_registry, WebPage

        @handle_urls("example.com", overrides=ProductPageObject)
        class ExampleComProductPage(WebPage):
            ...

        override_rules = default_registry.get_overrides()

    Notice that the ``@handle_urls`` that we're using is a part of the
    ``default_registry``. This provides a shorter and quicker way to interact
    with the built-in default :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` instead of writing
    the longer ``@default_registry.handle_urls``.

    .. note::

        It is encouraged to simply use and import the already existing registry
        via ``from web_poet import default_registry`` instead of creating your
        own :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` instance. Using multiple registries
        would be unwieldy in most cases.

        However, it might be applicable in certain scenarios like storing custom
        rules to separate it from the ``default_registry``. This :ref:`example
        <overrides-custom-registry>` from the tutorial section may provide some
        context.
