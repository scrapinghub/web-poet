class ApplyRule:
    """A rule that primarily applies Page Object and Item overrides for a given
    URL pattern.

    This is instantiated when using the :func:`web_poet.handle_urls` decorator.
    It's also being returned as a ``List[ApplyRule]`` when calling the
    ``web_poet.default_registry``'s :meth:`~.PageObjectRegistry.get_rules`
    method.

    You can access any of its attributes:

        * ``for_patterns`` - contains the list of URL patterns associated with
          this rule. You can read the API documentation of the `url-matcher
          <https://url-matcher.readthedocs.io/>`_ package for more information
          about the patterns.
        * ``use`` - The Page Object that will be **used** in cases where the URL
          pattern represented by the ``for_patterns`` attribute is matched.
        * ``instead_of`` - *(optional)* The Page Object that will be **replaced**
          with the Page Object specified via the ``use`` parameter.
        * ``to_return`` - *(optional)* The item class which the **used**
        * ``to_return`` - *(optional)* The item class that the Page Object specified
          in ``use`` is capable of returning.
        * ``meta`` - *(optional)* Any other information you may want to store.
          This doesn't do anything for now but may be useful for future API updates.

    The main functionality of this class lies in the ``instead_of`` and ``to_return``
    parameters. Should both of these be omitted, then :class:`~.ApplyRule` simply
    tags which URL patterns the given Page Object defined in ``use`` is expected
    to be used on.

    When ``to_return`` is not None (e.g. ``to_return=MyItem``),
    the Page Object in ``use`` is declared as capable of returning a certain
    item class (i.e. ``MyItem``).

    When ``instead_of`` is not None (e.g. ``instead_of=ReplacedPageObject``),
    the rule adds an expectation that the ``ReplacedPageObject`` wouldn't
    be used for the URLs matching ``for_patterns``, since the Page Object
    in ``use`` will replace it.

    If there are multiple rules which match a certain URL, the rule
    to apply is picked based on the priorities set in ``for_patterns``.

    More information regarding its usage in :ref:`rules-intro`.

    .. tip::

        The :class:`~.ApplyRule` is also hashable. This makes it easy to store
        unique rules and identify any duplicates.

class PageObjectRegistry(dict):
    """This contains the :class:`~.ApplyRule` that associates the Page Objects
    alongside its Items for a given URL matching rule.

    PageObjectRegistry is a ``dict`` subclass with added functionalities on
    storing, retrieving, and searching for the :class:`~.ApplyRule` instances.
    The **value** represents the :class:`~.ApplyRule` instance from which the
    Page Object in the **key** is allowed to be used. Since it's essentially a
    ``dict``, you can use any ``dict`` operations with it.

    ``web-poet`` already provides a default Registry named ``default_registry``
    for convenience. It can be directly accessed via:

    .. code-block:: python

        from web_poet import handle_urls, default_registry, WebPage

        @handle_urls("example.com", instead_of=ProductPageObject)
        class ExampleComProductPage(WebPage[ProductItem]):
            ...

        rules = default_registry.get_rules()

    Notice that the ``@handle_urls`` decorator that we're using is a part of the
    ``default_registry``. This provides a shorter and quicker way to interact
    with the built-in default :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` instead of writing
    the longer ``@default_registry.handle_urls``.

    .. note::

        It is encouraged to simply use and import the already existing registry
        via ``from web_poet import default_registry`` instead of creating your
        own :class:`~.PageObjectRegistry` instance. Using multiple registries
        would be unwieldy in most cases.

        However, it might be applicable in certain scenarios like storing custom
        rules to separate it from the ``default_registry``. This :ref:`example
        <rules-custom-registry>` from the tutorial section may provide some
        context.

        Class decorator that indicates that the decorated Page Object should work
        for the given URL patterns.

        The URL patterns are matched using the ``include`` and ``exclude``
        parameters while ``priority`` breaks any ties. See the documentation
        of the `url-matcher <https://url-matcher.readthedocs.io/>`_ package for
        more information about them.

        This decorator is able to derive the item class returned by the Page
        Object (see :ref:`rules-item-class-example` section for some examples). This is
        important since it marks what type of item the Page Object is capable of
        returning for the given URL patterns. For certain advanced cases, you can
        pass a ``to_return`` parameter which replaces any derived values (though
        this isn't generally recommended).

        Passing another Page Object into the ``instead_of`` parameter indicates
        that the decorated Page Object will be used instead of that for the given
        set of URL patterns. This is the concept of **overrides** (see the
        :ref:`rules-intro-overrides` section for more info`).

        Any extra parameters are stored as meta information that can be later used.

        :param include: The URLs that should be handled by the decorated Page Object.
        :param instead_of: The Page Object that should be `replaced`.
        :param to_return: The item class holding the data returned by the Page Object.
            This could be omitted as it could be derived from the ``Returns[ItemClass]``
            or ``ItemPage[ItemClass]`` declaration of the Page Object. See
            :ref:`item-classes` section. Code example in :ref:`rules-combination` subsection.
        :param exclude: The URLs for which the Page Object should **not** be applied.
        :param priority: The resolution priority in case of `conflicting` rules.
            A conflict happens when the ``include``, ``override``, and ``exclude``
            parameters are the same. If so, the `highest priority` will be
            chosen.
