    using the detected encoding of the response, preferably according
    to the web browser rules (respecting Content-Type header, etc.)

    The following are optional since it would depend on the source of the
    ``ResponseData`` if these are available or not. For example, the responses
    could simply come off from a local HTML file which doesn't contain ``headers``
    and ``status``.

    ``status`` should represent the int status code of the HTTP response.

    ``headers`` should contain the HTTP response headers.
